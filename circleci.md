# Circle CI

Good:

* Native slack integration
* Can SSH in to debug a build
* Parallelization: trade money for speed :)
* Good docs
* Good integration with GitHub, e.g. creates SSH key for machine user

Meh:

* Can't add custom stages. Everything has to fit into 'test' and 'deployment'

Bad:

* Hard to remember whether to put a space in the name or not!
